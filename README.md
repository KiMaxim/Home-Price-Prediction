# Home Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project predicts house prices based on house sizes using **Linear Regression**. It demonstrates basic **data visualization** with Matplotlib and **machine learning** with scikit-learn. On top of that, in file _scracth.py_ I have implemented linear regression from scratch, without _sklearn_. Later, I would like to try to show the comparison of accuracy between these two methods of implementaion. 

* **Dataset**: `home_dataset.csv` containing `HouseSize` (square feet) and `HousePrice` ($).
* **Steps**:

  1. Load and explore data using Pandas.
  2. Visualize relationships with scatter plots.
  3. Split data into training and testing sets.
  4. Train a Linear Regression model to predict house prices.
  5. Compare actual vs predicted prices using plots.

## Notes

* This is an **initial version** of the project.
* Future development may include:

  * Incorporating more features (e.g., number of bedrooms, location)
  * Using advanced regression or machine learning algorithms
  * Adding performance metrics and model evaluation
